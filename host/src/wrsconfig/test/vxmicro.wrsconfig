#CONFIG_NANO_KERNEL                   Enable Nanokernel-only mode


#When nanokernel-only mode is set to 'n' then I have the following additional booleans:


# CONFIG_STANDALONE       Run without a host server (if set to 'y', this forces  CPU_LOAD, RUNTIME_CTRL and INSTRUMENTATION to be 'n')

# CONFIG_CPU_LOAD         Enable CPU load monitor
# CONFIG_RUNTIME_CTRL     Enable task runtime Control
# CONFIG_INSTRUMENTATION  Enable system instrumentation
# CONFIG_ROUND_ROBIN  Enable round-robin scheduling 
# CONFIG_MULTIMODE        Choose SP or MP version of the VSP
