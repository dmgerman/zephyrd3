	  Thumb-2 technology is the instruction set underlying the ARM Cortex
	  architecture which provides enhanced levels of performance, energy
	  efficiency, and code density for a wide range of embedded
	  applications.

	  Thumb-2 technology builds on the success of Thumb, the innovative
	  high code density instruction set for ARM microprocessor cores, to
	  increase the power of the ARM microprocessor core available to
	  developers of low cost, high performance systems.

	  The technology is backwards compatible with existing ARM and Thumb
	  solutions, while significantly extending the features available to
	  the Thumb instructions set. This allows more of the application to
	  benefit from the best in class code density of Thumb.

	  For performance optimised code Thumb-2 technology uses 31 percent
	  less memory to reduce system cost, while providing up to 38 percent
	  higher performance than existing high density code, which can be used
	  to prolong battery-life or to enrich the product feature set. Thumb-2
	  technology is featured in the  processor, and in all ARMv7
	  architecture-based processors.

	  The ARM 32-bit instruction set is the base 32-bit ISA used in the
	  ARMv4T, ARMv5TEJ and ARMv6 architectures.  In these architectures it
	  is used in applications requiring high performance, or for handling
	  hardware exceptions such as interrupts and processor start-up.

	  The ARM 32-bit ISA is also supported in the Cortex-A and Cortex-R
	  profiles of the Cortex architecture for performance critical
	  applications, and for legacy code.  Most of its functionality is
	  subsumed into the Thumb-2 instruction set, which also benefits from
	  improved code density.

	  ARM instructions are 32-bits wide, and are aligned on 4-byte
	  boundaries.

	  All ARM instructions can also be conditionalised to only execute when
	  previous instructions have set a particular condition code. This
	  means that instructions only have their normal effect on the
	  programmersâ€™ model operation, memory and coprocessors if the N, Z, C
	  and V flags in the Application Program Status Register satisfy a
	  condition specified in the instruction. If the flags do not satisfy
	  this condition, the instruction acts as a NOP, that is, execution
	  advances to the next instruction as normal, including any relevant
	  checks for exceptions being taken, but has no other effect.  This
	  conditionalisation of instructions allows small sections of if- and
	  while-statements to be encoded without the use of branch
	  instructions.

	  Thumb technology is an extension to the 32-bit ARM architecture. The
	  Thumb instruction set features a subset of the most commonly used
	  32-bit ARM instructions which have been compressed into 16-bit wide
	  opcodes. On execution, these 16-bit instructions are decompressed
	  transparently to full 32-bit ARM instructions in real time without
	  performance loss.

	  Designers can use both 16-bit Thumb and 32-bit ARM instructions sets
	  and therefore have the flexibility to emphasise performance or code
	  size on a sub-routine level as their applications require.

	  A Thumb-aware core is a standard ARM processor fitted with a Thumb
	  decompressor in the instruction pipeline. The designer therefore
	  gets	all the underlying power of the 32-bit ARM architecture as well
	  as excellent code density from Thumb, all at 8-bit system cost.

	  Thumb has better code density than common 8 and 16-bit CISC/RISC
	  Controllers and is at a fraction of the code size of traditional
	  32-bit architectures. This means that program memory can be smaller
	  and hence cost reduced.
