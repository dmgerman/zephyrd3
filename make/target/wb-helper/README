Directory meant to host files that create the list of setting information
retrieved by Workbench host tools. Add files as needed for different types
of builds:

  defs.kernel
  defs.nkernel
  defs.ukernel
  defs.klib
  defs.nklib
  defs.uklib
  defs.library

For displaying variables for a specific type of build, the variable
iVARIABLES_TO_DISPLAY should be added to with the list of variables to
display, using the '+=' operator. This allows inheritance between different
types of build: eg. An nkernel build is a kernel build and an nklib build,
which is itself a klib build. This feeds the 'make display_variables' build
rule.

The files do not have to exist if included via 'sinclude': this is the way
the files are included in the top make.<build type> files.
